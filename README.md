# Civ5mod - Winter Wonderland
A winter wonderland of snowmen and snowy terrain

- Frosty The Snowman improovements for all on Snow, Tundra, Grass,Hills and Plain tiles 
- Frosty The Snowman improovements are faster with Bronze working and Mining

- Frosty The Snowman improovements improoves Reindeer
- Frosty The Snowman improovements provides +1 Culture with Printing Press
- Frosty The Snowman has the unique red ribbon tophat
- Terrain changes to Grass and Plains tiles (they all have snow on the ground)

For future versions: Snow could be added to trees and jungle textures. 

Notice/compitability: 
- Running this mod and the North Pole Mod will render the two snowmen improvements with the same graphics. It seems possible, but everytime I rename the Frosty textures the rendering fails.
- The North Pole Santa elfes cannot build Frosty The Snowman, only his own snowmen. This should even out the game. Can be enabled in UnitBuilds.xml

Thank you to:
- Inspiration credit to calcul8or for the North Pole MOD (v0 3).
- Graphic model converted from Civ IV by DJSHenninger, originally created by saibotlieh.
